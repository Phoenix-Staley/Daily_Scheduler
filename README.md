# Daily Scheduler

## Application

This application use Moment with JavaScript to create 1 day worth of tasks that the user can save for when they leave and return.

## APIs

This application makes use of jQuery, Moment, and Boostrap. Even though JavaScript has adopted many of the functionalities of jQuery, it is still used in many web applications today, and this is why I used it in this application.
